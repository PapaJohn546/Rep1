   Morbius is the most movie of all time with the most acting ever the most action ever. It's <br> the best experience I've ever had watching a  film. It's that good and it's perfect. In this review I'm going to go over the best moments in the film and the amazing soundtrack that was made for this masterpiece. The success of this movie will never be topped unless a sequel comes out because only then will it truly be "morbin time"

      In case you don't believe me just watch this clip of the dance scene. Just be aware that it might <br> spoil the movie for you. Go see it  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YvbmgnOtd6omWifNg0BdY6JtL18s3UK6/view?usp=sharing"> here </a>

        <p> At this point of the story all you know is that he's crippled and super smart, so when this scene happens it's excellent foreshadowing that he'll be able to control bats. It's the amazing story telling that makes this film unique. </p>
        <li> The finale </li>
        <img width= 450 height= 250 src="https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jared-Leto-Morbius-Bat-Swarm.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=963&h=481&dpr=1.5" >
        <p> Why is this finale so good? Well I'm glad you asked because there's a lot of reasons. First of all he can control bats by this time. How? That doesn't matter, but he can do it. This allows him to do a dragon ball reference in the middle of the his fight. People love to praise The Batman, but he kind of a clown. He calls himself Batman and yet he can't control bats himself and guess what....Morbius can. Not onlt that, but Morbius has more character development than any film I've ever seen. The entire movie is focused on Dr. Michael Morbius, so when they fight at the end it's rewarding and sad to see two friends fight each other. It's tragic. </p>

          <li> User J-Nah- Morbius is the great. Truly the best cinema has to offer, I never expected a live action movie of Scooby Doo to hit me harder than my da-I mean, harder than my failing grades. Truly the best the Forza franchise has to offer with unbelievable graphics stunning visuals, Amorbus really shows you how Walter White who lives at 308 negra arroyo lane thinks by cooking cocainer and getting stage 4 terminal cancer(weird I always thought that was a zodiac sign). </li>
          <p></p> <p></p>
          <li> User ライムMxv87-  I cried when Mobius and venom said "its morbin time" and proceeded to become venom,also My good friend bryant moreland was also there , (he is known as EDP445) "And he didnt really do anything wrong just so everyone knows he is innocent and just wanted a cupcake." because we are venom , and then I started crying when venom teamed up with morbingus and killed spider man from the hit game among us, And then the among us imposter came into the scene and killed scooby doo and fortnite for possesion of illegal drugs , Than lebron james and among us team up with venom and morbingus to take over the world of the space jam, and than after that Rkelly and sonic2 attacked them and then they almost died but morbiobus and lebron james welcomed them to the space jam, and then they played the game team fortress 2 , which was developed by valve who owns will smiths children and family, who I have in my basement steam, After this the movie seems over and calm until the red sus from among us comes from vent and says "among us sus" which almost kills venom from the hit movie space jam a new legacy, I also liked the part when venom nukes russia and ukraine and morbiobusbus attacks ukraine with stinky poop, which was kinda scary but honestly I think lebron james and R kelly were great heroes and villans,

          <li>User William Cao- Spider-Man is a 2002 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by David Koepp, it is the first installment in Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, and stars Tobey Maguire as the titular character, alongside Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and Rosemary Harris. The film chronicles Spider-Man's origins and early superhero career. After being bitten by a genetically-altered spider, outcast teenage genius Peter Parker develops spider-like superhuman abilities and adopts a masked identity to fight crime and injustice in New York City, facing the villainous Green Goblin in the process. </li>

          <li> User Joseph Broderick- Both Jared Leto and Matt Smith are awesome as Michael and Milo Morbius including Fast & Furious actor Tyrese Gibson who plays Simon Stroud, an FBI agent who hunts and tracks down Morbius. The film combines both action and horror and which lead it to getting a few bit of praises. All of the dreary and dark vibes from the film are even effective enough in building the characters including their motivations. If your like any villians from Spider-Man then I suggest you give Morbius a watch. Gonna give this film 5 vampire bats.</li> </blockquote>

          <p> Everything else I said I was going to talk is now going to be thrown out the window because I'm sure I have you sold ont he moviue by now. This movie has changed lives. There will be people to say it's trash, but those people are the real trolls because it's impossible not to like this film. There's a lot of memes about it for a reason. It sold over one morbillion dollars opening day which is more than Spider-Man No Way Home which compared to this is trash.
